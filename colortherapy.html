			<br>
			<p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 20px;">Color therapy, also known as chromotherapy, is a form of therapy that uses color and light to treat certain mental and physical health conditions. We can trace this form of therapy back to the ancient Egyptians. They made use of sun-filled rooms with colored glasses for therapeutic purposes.</p>

			<br>
			<p style="line-height: 2; text-indent: 20px;">In color therapy, different colors are thought to be able to treat various conditions. Color therapists believe that a lack of a particular color in your body might be responsible for your living condition. Here’s a list of the most common colors used during color therapy and how we can use them.</p>
			<ul type="square" style="line-height: 2;">
				<blockquote style="background-color: red; "><li>Red: Red is used to energize or invigorate a person who might be feeling tired or down. However, red may also trigger people who might already be tense, which is why it’s used carefully in color therapy.</li></blockquote>
			<blockquote style="background-color: blue;"><li>Blue: Chromatherapists use blue to treat depression and pain. Darker shades of blue are also thought to have sedative properties and may be helpful for people who experience insomnia or other sleeping disorders.</li></blockquote>
			<blockquote style="background-color: green;"><li>Green: Green is the color of nature, and according to chromatherapists, it can help relieve stress and relax a person.</li></blockquote>
			<blockquote style="background-color: yellow;"><li>Yellow: Yellow can be used to improve your mood and make you happy and optimistic.</li></blockquote>
				<blockquote style="background-color: orange;"><li>Orange: Orange, much like yellow, can be used to elicit happy emotions from people. The bright warm color is also thought to be able to stimulate appetite and mental activity.</li></blockquote>
